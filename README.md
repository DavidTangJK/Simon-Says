# Simon-Says

A Simon Says game build using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project was part of the course "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu from Udemy.

You begin the game by pressing a key on the keyboard. 
Once the game starts, repeat the random sequences that Simon gives. The game will get progressively harder once you enter the correct sequence repeatedly.

You may go to https://davidtangjk.github.io/Simon-Says/ to test out or play the game.
